# Huikka - The drinking game!

This is my first free time project. **Huikka** is Finnish and it means little sip of (alcohol) drink. In this game have to take one or more **Huikka** for penalty if you won't complete tasks in time. 

This game is made for my friend group. The idea ensued when we didn't have any idea what to do together. With this game you will learn something new from your opponents, have fun desired and drinking is guaranteed. Also in the end we will have winner as the game will count points automatically.

> **Note:** This game is still in progress. Not ready yet!! Instructions and game features will be published later.
